# Simple Spectral PDEs

This small repository implements pseudospectral solvers for a few one-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) in periodic domains. In each case, the solver uses in-place fast Fourier transforms and time-steppers from [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/solvers/ode_solve/) for fast, high-accuracy, and stable solutions. The density of the grid can be any power of two. The three PDEs equations implemented are, in order of solutions with increasing complexity:

#### Advection-Diffusion

$$ u_t = -v(x,t)u_x + D u_{xx} $$

where $v(x,t)$ is a velocity function that can be any periodic function of space and time and $D$ is a diffusion coefficient. The example below shows a solution from a random initial condition on a 512 point grid with $v(x,t)=1.25 + \cos(x + 2 \pi t/25)$ and $D=10^{-4}$. The diffusion acts mostly in the migrating low-velocity zone where the ripples are compressed and $u_{xx}$ is highest.

#### Kortewegâ€“De Vries 

$$ u_t = -u u_x - a^2u_{xxx} $$

This is a simplified shallow water wave model with a lot of nonlinearity and a third-order derivative.

#### Kuramoto-Sivashinsky

$$ u_t = -u_{xx} - u_{xxxx} - u u_{x} $$

A fourth-order PDE famous for its chaotic behavior. The model produces different behavior for different domain length, which causes the terms above to have different scaling.

It is authored by Mark Baum <markmbaum@protonmail.com>.

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a Julia console and do:
   ```
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.add("DrWatson") # install globally, for using `quickactivate`
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and everything should work out of the box, including correctly finding local paths.
